A simple game where players are trying to guess which characters has been choosen by other. To play game first you have to login with Google credentials, then you have to pick room where you want to play. When you enter the room if you didn't chose character to guees by other players - now you have to do it. In roomthere are two areas: 'Players in the room', where you can see yourself, other players and characters which had been choosen. You can also see a guess-status of every player. Here you can place your guesses. Second area is 'Chat', where you can ask a helper questions to others which you can use to guess who is who. But be carefull - in chat there is a place only for 25 questions. After that limit the oldest of them dissapear! Below thea board of the room there are three options: leaving room without deleting your character in current room (because you could want to play in many rooms at once, right?), leaving room and deleting your character and changing your character.
